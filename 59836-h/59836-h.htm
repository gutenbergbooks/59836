<br />GLACIER NATIONAL PARK</h1>
<p class="center">By JAMES L. DYSON
<br />Head, Department of Geology and Geography
<br />Lafayette College<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Until recently a geologist was visualized by most people as a queer
sort of fellow who went around the countryside breaking rocks with a
little hammer. Fortunately, the general public today has a much clearer
picture of the geologist and his science, but there are still many among
us who mistakenly feel that geology is something too remote for practical
application.</p>
<p>Geology is the science of the Earth. It includes a history of our
planet starting with its origin, and a history of the life which has lived
upon it. From it we can determine the reason for every feature of the
landscape and every rock structure underneath the surface, and we can
further learn what processes gave rise to them.</p>
<p>Practically everything to be seen on the face of the Earth owes
its origin directly or indirectly to geological processes. These may be
grouped into two great categories: Internal forces or agents which
raise, lower, bend, and break the Earth&rsquo;s crust; and external, more
familiar agents such as water, wind, and ice, which wear away the surface
and carry the materials to another place&mdash;ultimately to the sea.
Let us consider a few of the products of these geologic agents: (1) The
soil covering most of the landscape and furnishing the plant products
which serve as our food; (2) the solid rock, so conspicuous in all mountain
ranges; (3) the hills, the valleys, and the mountains; (4) all the
streams, ponds, lakes&mdash;even the sea. If you live in a place where man
has covered up the rock and the soil evidence of geological processes
is yielded by the buildings themselves, whether they be of stone quarried
from the Earth&rsquo;s crust, or of brick made from clay. The stone and brick
are supported by a framework of steel originally taken from a mine in
the form of iron ore. The concrete and asphalt of the roads came from
rocks within the Earth, as did every drop of gasoline which plays so
vital a part in world affairs today. Even those commonplaces of American
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
life, the bottle and the &ldquo;tin&rdquo; can, are products of geology. As you
read this you need look only at your watch or perhaps an item of jewelry
which you wear to see something&mdash;gold, silver, platinum, a diamond or
other gem stone&mdash;which is a part of geology.</p>
<p>Thus, from here it is a short step to the realization that a number of
geologic processes and agents working over long periods of time have
given rise to innumerable features and structures ranging from the loftiest
mountains down to the smallest hills and valleys; from the soil which
grows our food to the gasoline and coal which feed our industries; from
our huge iron ore deposits down to the much smaller, but now no less
significant, deposits of uranium.</p>
<p>How is all this related to a national park? Nowhere within our
land can the accomplishments of the great geological processes, or their
present-day operation, be seen to better advantage than in many of our
national parks and monuments. In fact, it is for this reason principally
that many of them were established. Notable is Grand Canyon National
Park, containing the most spectacular part of the Colorado&rsquo;s mile-deep
canyon cut during the past million or so years through a series of rocks
which themselves record a billion or more years of Earth history. Mount
Rainier is the largest volcano in the United States. On it glaciers are
now wearing away materials formerly extruded and piled up to spectacular
height by volcanic forces. Crater Lake lies in the sunken throat of a
volcano which at one time probably rivaled Rainier in size. In Carlsbad
Caverns and Mammoth Cave National Parks are two of the world&rsquo;s
largest caverns which clearly demonstrate the tremendous effectiveness
of subsurface water in dissolving limestone. Bryce Canyon and Zion
National Parks and the Badlands National Monument illustrated on a
much smaller but no less spectacular scale than the Grand Canyon the
wonderful erosive power of running water. In Grand Teton one can see
a huge block of the crust which has been raised thousands of feet along
a high-angle fault, and at Lassen Peak in California and Craters of
the Moon in Idaho there are exhibited some of the most recent volcanic
features north of the Rio Grande. Despite Yellowstone&rsquo;s wildlife and
fishing it is best known perhaps for its geysers. This brief list is by no
means complete, for something of prime geologic interest can be found
in almost every national park and monument.</p>
<p>Now we come to Glacier National Park. Within its boundaries there
perhaps is exhibited a greater variety of geologic features than in any
of the others. Much of the park lies above timberline so that the
rocks which comprise its mountains are exposed to view. Held within
these superb mountains is an entertaining geologic story which they are
anxious and willing to tell us. All we need to do is unlock the door with
the key the geologist gives us and then go see for ourselves. Why do
the mountains rise so precipitously above the plains? What is that
conspicuous black band across the faces of so many of the peaks, and
how did it get there? Why are some of the rocks so red? The answers
to these and other questions come out as the geologic story unfolds.
The American people are interested in this story for they realize that to
understand what they see is to increase their enjoyment thousandfold.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<h2 id="c2">The Story Begins</h2>
<p>The most striking feature of the mountains&mdash;certainly the one
which comes first to a visitor&rsquo;s attention&mdash;is the color banding. No
matter where one looks this feature greets his view. If he enters the
park at the St. Mary Entrance, there ahead on the sides of Singleshot
and East Flattop Mountains are white and purple bands. Should he
enter first the Swiftcurrent Valley, he would soon note the banding in
the mountains lying to his right and left, and finally culminating in the
precipitous Garden Wall at the head of the valley. The visitor soon
realizes that every mountain within the park is composed of rock layers
of various colors. With very few exceptions these strata are of sedimentary
origin; that is, they accumulated by depositions of muds and
sands in a body of water and are now mainly limestones, shales, and
sandstones. These sedimentary rocks all belong to a single large unit
known as the Belt series, so named because of exposures in the Little
Belt and Big Belt Mountains farther south in Montana. In Glacier
National Park these rocks, which have a maximum thickness of more
than 20,000 feet, are in the form of a large syncline (downfold), the east
and west edges of which form the crests of the Lewis and Livingstone
Ranges (<a href="#fig_3">Figure 3</a>D). Throughout the large area of western Montana,
northern Idaho, and southern British Columbia where Belt rocks occur,
they are important mountain-makers. In addition to the ranges already
mentioned they are the principal rocks in many others, including the
Mission, Swan, and Flathead in the region south of Glacier Park; the
Bitterroot and Coeur d&rsquo;Alene between Idaho and Montana; and the
Purcell in British Columbia. Further, rocks of similar age form the
core of the Uinta Range in Utah and the lower section of the Grand
Canyon in Arizona.</p>
<p>During the Proterozoic Era of Earth history a long, narrow section
of North America extending from the Arctic Ocean southward, probably
as far as Arizona and southern California, slowly sank to form a large,
shallow, sea-filled trough known as a geosyncline (<a href="#fig_1">Figure 1</a>). Streams
from adjacent lands carried muds and sands into the sea, at times almost
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
completely filling it. Inasmuch as thousands of feet of sediments were
deposited, the geosyncline must have continued to sink throughout the
period of sedimentation. Eventually the muds were compacted into
shales, or limestones if they contained a lot of lime, and the sands into
sandstones. These are the rocks we now know as the Belt series. The
surfaces of many of the sandstone layers are covered with ripple marks
which could have been made only by wave and current action in shallow
water. Mudcracks on many of the shale beds prove that at times the
sediments, probably near the mouths of rivers were exposed to the air
long enough to dry out. Great thicknesses
of limestone and numerous
fossils of calcareous algae, primitive
marine plants, are evidences
that the body of water was a sea.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="small">FIGURE 1. BELT GEOSYNCLINE</span></p>
</div>
<p>Throughout the geologic past the
appearance and disappearance of
seas on the continents have been
frequent events. In fact such
changes are slowly taking place
even today. Hudson Bay and the
Baltic and North Seas are examples
of shallow seas situated on the continents.
The area around Hudson
Bay is rising; as attested by the
fact that some of the fish weirs
constructed in water along the
shore during the past several hundred
years are now a considerable
distance inland. We know also that
our Atlantic coast has been subsiding
for a number of years at an
annual rate of about 0.02 feet. To
be sure, these movements are slow, but if continued over a long period
they might conceivably make some rather profound changes, even as the
birth and death of the Belt sea.</p>
<p>Within Glacier National Park the Belt series is divided on the basis
of lithologic differences into six distinct formations. Because each has
a characteristic color, these formations can easily be identified, often
from distances of several miles. Usually two, sometimes three or four,
of them comprise a single mountain, the oldest always at the mountain
base and the youngest on the summit, this being the relative position in
which they were deposited in the form of sediment.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h2 id="c3">The Belt Formations</h2>
<h3 id="c4">ALTYN FORMATION.</h3>
<p>This is the oldest of the several formations
and thus occupies a stratigraphic position at the base of the entire series.
It is composed mainly of sandy dolomites (magnesian limestones) and
limestones which weather to a light buff color. It outcrops all along the
base of the eastern front of the Lewis Range and comprises the entire
block of Chief Mountain. Because of its comparatively great resistance
to weathering and erosion it usually forms a conspicuous ridge or terrace
wherever it crosses a valley. In the Swiftcurrent Valley it forms the
dam which holds in Swiftcurrent Lake and creates Swiftcurrent Falls.
In Two Medicine Valley the highway crosses a similar terrace which
gives rise also to Trick Falls. In the St. Mary Valley it creates the
Narrows and forms the imposing wall in lee of which East Glacier Campground
is located. The rock of this formation can best be examined on
the ridge immediately east of Many Glacier Hotel (between hotel and
parking lot) and above Swiftcurrent Falls. Its average thickness is
about 2,300 feet.</p>
<h3 id="c5">APPEKUNNY FORMATION.</h3>
<p>Lying on top of the Altyn are 3,000
or more feet of prevailing greenish shales and argillites<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> comprising
the Appekunny formation. Slabs of these rocks, because of their great
hardness, have been used as flagstones in the walks at the Many Glacier
Ranger Station and adjacent Park Service residential area. Mud cracks
and ripple marks are common. The formation is prominent on the side
of Singleshot Mountain near the St. Mary entrance to the park, and
everywhere immediately overlying the lighter-hued Altyn along the
east edge of the Lewis Range where, especially when seen from a distance,
it appears to have a purplish color. It also outcrops along the
western base of the Livingstone Range (<a href="#fig_3">Figure 3</a>D), but such exposures
are as a rule obscured by a cover of dense forest. Accessible outcrops
can readily be examined along Going-to-the-Sun Highway for several
miles east of Sun Point and near McDonald Falls, and also along the
lower part of the Grinnell Glacier trail.</p>
<h3 id="c6">GRINNELL FORMATION.</h3>
<p>Because of their dominantly red color,
the shaly argillites which comprise the bulk of this formation are the
most conspicuous rocks in the park. They lie immediately on top of
the Appekunny and although their thickness varies considerably it is
greater than 3,000 feet in several localities. Interbedded with the red
argillites are thin white layers of quartzite, a former sandstone which
has been converted by pressure into an extraordinarily hard, dense rock.
Mud cracks, ripple and current marks, raindrop impressions, and other
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
features made while the sediments were accumulating are common. The
red color is due to abundant iron oxide occurring mainly as a cement
between the sand and mud grains. All the rocks of Glacier Park contain
some iron, or rather contain iron-bearing minerals. These minerals have
various colors unless they have been oxidized, in which case the color
is red or brown. Oxidation of the Grinnell formation probably took
place while the mud was accumulating and during those periods when
it was exposed to the atmosphere. At such times also the mud dried
and cracked, the marks of which are so prominent on the surfaces of
the layers today.</p>
<p>The Grinnell formation seems to be everywhere. In the Many
Glacier region it comprises the bulk of Grinnell Point, Altyn Peak, and
Mount Allen, and is no less striking in the bases of Mount Wilbur and
the Garden Wall. Ptarmigan Tunnel is drilled through it, and the trails
to Grinnell Glacier, Cracker and Iceberg Lakes cross it. Redrock Falls,
on the trail to Swiftcurrent Pass, and Ptarmigan Falls on the Iceberg
Lake trail drop over several of its highly colored layers.</p>
<p>From the Blackfeet Highway on top of Two Medicine Ridge one can
see the dark red rocks of this formation capping the summits of Rising
Wolf and Red Mountains. Even from the valley floor it is just as
noticeable. Sinopah Mountain standing alone and impressive across the
lake from Two Medicine Chalets carries the red banner of the Grinnell
formation.</p>
<p>These red rocks constitute an important scenic feature for many
miles along Going-to-the-Sun Highway. If one begins his trip on this
highway at its east entrance he soon finds himself in the midst of a group
of imposing red peaks&mdash;Goat and Going-to-the-Sun on the right, Red
Eagle and Mahtotopa on the left. The road crosses the formation along
a mile and a half stretch just west of Baring Creek bridge. Innumerable
loose slabs of red rock along the side of the road contain excellent mud
cracks and ripple marks. Near Avalanche creek on the west side of
Logan Pass the highway crosses the Grinnell where it comes to the surface
on the western limb of the big syncline.</p>
<p>The formation is well exposed in the vicinity of Sperry Chalet and
Glacier. It forms all the mountains surrounding the basin in which
the chalet is located, and the trail from chalet to glacier lies wholly on
it. At the glacier intensely folded white quartzite layers and red argillites
are very conspicuous.</p>
<p>The visitor can readily trace the Grinnell from place to place
throughout the entire park area, and can thus easily visualize that it
as well as all other formations at one time filled the intervening spaces
between the mountains. (See color of <a href="#cover">cover pages</a>.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h3 id="c7">SIYEH FORMATION.</h3>
<p>Next above the Grinnell is a thick limestone
formation which, because of its weathered buff color, stands out in sharp
contrast to the red beds upon which it rests. It is the greatest cliff-maker
in the park and in several places its entire thickness of 4,000 feet may
be exposed in a single nearly vertical cliff. Since it is younger than the
three preceding formations, it is confined mainly to the higher elevations,
capping many of the loftiest peaks within the Lewis and Livingstone
Ranges. In the Many Glacier area such peaks are Mount Gould and the
Garden Wall, Mounts Siyeh, Grinnell, Allen, Wilbur, and Henkel. A
number of others, including Little Chief, Jackson, Gunsight, Fusillade,
Going-to-the-Sun, Piegan, Pollock, Cannon, and Heavens Peak, are visible
from Going-to-the-Sun Highway. The huge peaks&mdash;Kinnerly, Kintla,
Carter, and Rainbow&mdash;which stand guard at the heads of Kintla and
Bowman Lakes are composed of the Siyeh. The list also includes Cleveland,
highest and largest of all.</p>

<p class="caption">GENTLY TILTED STRATA OF THE SIYEH FORMATION IN GRINNELL MOUNTAIN.
<span class="jr">(DYSON PHOTO)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Within the Siyeh there is a bed,
averaging about 60 feet thick, composed
almost entirely of fossil algae
which apparently formed an extensive
reef or biostrome on the floor
of the shallow Belt Sea. The algae
colonies are in the form of rounded
masses up to several feet in diameter
and bear a crude resemblance
externally and internally to
a head of lettuce or cabbage. Geologists
know these algae by the genus
name <b>Collenia</b>. Because of the rounded and smoothed surfaces on these
colonies, mountain climbers frequently find the reef difficult to cross. It
appears as a distinct light gray
horizontal band on the east face
of Mount Wilbur about midway between
the base of the cliff and the
peak&rsquo;s summit, where it can easily
be seen from Many Glacier Hotel
and Swiftcurrent Camp. It is also
discernible on the Pinnacle Wall
above Iceberg Lake and in Mount
Grinnell. The Swiftcurrent Pass
trail crosses it just east of the pass,
and it is also exposed along Going-to-the-Sun
Highway below the big
switchback on the west side of
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
Logan Pass where attention is directed to it by a sign. Unweathered portions
of the reef rock are light blue. A similar but thinner reef outcrops
at Logan Pass near the start of the
Hidden Lake trail. Although most
of the fossil algae occur in the Siyeh
they are present in the younger formations
and also in the Altyn. Other
than algae the only undoubted fossils
of the Belt series within Glacier
National Park are burrows probably
made by worms. They are rare
and are restricted mainly to the
Siyeh formation.</p>

<span class="jr">(THE ROCK BOOK BY C. L. FENTON AND M. A. FENTON, DOUBLEDAY AND CO.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>At the top of the Siyeh are several
hundred feet of sandy and
shaly beds, mostly reddish in color,
grouped by some geologists into a distinct formation known as the
<b>Spokane</b>. At Logan Pass it is about 700 feet thick and is well exposed
in the lower parts of Clements and Reynolds Mountains, and at the site
of the former &ldquo;Clements&rdquo; Glacier.</p>
<h3 id="c8">SHEPARD FORMATION.</h3>
<p>Several hundred feet of limy beds which
weather yellow-brown lie on top of the Siyeh. Although named for outcrops
on the cliff above Shepard Glacier (south of Stoney Indian Pass
and near the site of the old Fifty-Mountain tent camp) the formation is
exposed on the summit of Swiftcurrent Mountain at the head of Swiftcurrent
Valley, on Reynolds and Clements Mountains near Logan Pass,
and on Citadel and Almost-a-Dog, visible from Going-to-the-Sun Highway
in St. Mary Valley. The formation is replete with mud cracks and ripple
marks. Some rock surfaces exhibit two and three sets of the latter.</p>
<h3 id="c9">KINTLA FORMATION.</h3>
<p>These beds have the same bright red color
as those of the Grinnell. However, because they are the youngest rocks
of the Belt series they outcrop only on a few mountaintops, and inasmuch
as these are mainly in the northwest part of the park, comparatively few
people have noticed this formation. Visitors to Cameron Lake in Waterton
Lakes National Park can see it in the red north wall of Mount Custer.
The mountains around colorful Boulder Pass and Hole-in-the-Wall Basin
are likewise composed of it.</p>
<p>Within the rocks of this formation there is a great abundance of
small cubes believed to be casts of salt crystals which formed when the
sediments were accumulating. Their presence indicates an arid climate
and intensive evaporation of the sea, similar to the condition at Great
Salt Lake today.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c10">Igneous Rocks of the Belt Series</h2>
<p>Not all of Glacier Park&rsquo;s rocks accumulated slowly and quietly as
sediment in a body of water. At many places, interbedded with and
cutting across the sediments, there
are bodies of igneous rock which
reached their present position in
the form of hot molten material
forced up from deep within the
crust.</p>

</table>
<h3 id="c11">PURCELL LAVA.</h3>
<p>Soon after the
youngest layers of Siyeh limestone
had accumulated on the floor of
the sea and while they were still
under water, a mass of molten rock
was squeezed up from far below
and extruded in the form of a submarine
lava flow over the recently
accumulated sediments. Several
times this lava poured out forming
a total thickness varying between
50 and 275 feet. One of the best
exposures is on the west side of
Swiftcurrent Pass and in Granite
Park just west and northwest of
the chalet. In fact it is this lava
flow which gives the name, albeit wrongly, to Granite Park. The material
of the flow is very fine-grained and dark (basic), in contrast to the light
color and coarse grain of granite. Nonetheless, many prospectors are
wont to call every igneous rock, regardless of its composition, a granite.
A number of ellipsoidal structures (&ldquo;pillows&rdquo;) up to two feet in diameter
within this lava indicate that it was extruded under water. The
Purcell is thickest in the vicinity of Boulder Pass, where the trail traverses
its ropy and stringy surface for a distance of several hundred yards.</p>
<p>Later, after the Shepard and part of the Kintla formation were
laid down on top of the Purcell, another similar flow spread over the
sea floor.</p>
<h3 id="c12">DIORITE SILL.</h3>
<p>Few persons visit the park without noticing the
pronounced black layer, within the Siyeh formation, present on many
of the high peaks. It is most in evidence on the face of the Garden
Wall viewed from the vicinity of Many Glacier Hotel, although it is
plainly visible also in Mount Wilbur and the wall above Iceberg Lake.
Passengers on the Waterton Lake launch can see it cutting across the
stupendous north face of Mount Cleveland. From Going-to-the-Sun Highway
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
it can be seen on Mahtotopa, Little Chief, Citadel, Piegan, and
Going-to-the-Sun Mountains, and on the west side of the Garden Wall,
where it also forms the cap of Haystack Butte. It is everywhere about
100 feet thick, and thus can be used as a very accurate scale for determining
the height of mountains on which it is discernible.</p>
<p>This imposing layer of rock, unlike
the lava, never reached the surface
in a molten state, but was
intruded between beds of sedimentary
rock and thus became a sill
instead of a flow. We need only a
glance to determine its intrusive
nature. Wherever it occurs it is
bordered at top and bottom by
thinner gray layers. These are
Siyeh limestone which was changed
to marble by the tremendous heat
of the diorite during its intrusion.
This effect is termed <b>contact metamorphism</b>
by geologists. Because
this contact-metamorphosed zone is at both top and bottom of the sill
we know the latter was intruded into the adjacent rocks. Lava flows,
even though covered later by sediments, of course alter only the underlying
rocks.</p>

</div>
<p>The sill can readily be examined in a number of places where trails
cross it, notably at Swiftcurrent
and Piegan Passes, and north of
Granite Park near Ahern Pass. But
nowhere is it as accessible as on
Logan Pass. It lies beneath the
parking lot at a depth of only a
few feet, and is exposed on both
sides of the pass. To inspect it, one
need walk only about 200 yards
along the trail leading to Granite
Park. In a distance of less than
100 feet the trail traverses from
fresh Siyeh limestone across the
entire altered (contact-metamorphosed)
zone, here 12 to 20 feet
wide, into the center of the sill. All
parts of the sill and adjacent rocks can readily be examined and studied
in detail at this site.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>A number of <b>dikes</b><a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> of Belt age, some of which undoubtedly were
feeders to the sill and flows, cut vertically up through the sedimentary
formations. Some of the dikes are less resistant to weathering and erosion
than the rocks surrounding them; consequently their more rapid
removal results in the formation of narrow vertical chimneys or recesses
which appear as snow-filled chutes on the mountainsides in spring and
early summer. Such a feature almost invariably indicates the presence
of a dike. From Many Glacier Hotel one of these can be seen on the red
mountain in front of Mount Wilbur. Another, 1,500 feet high, transects
the Pinnacle Wall at the outlet of Iceberg Lake. The dike which forms
this impressive chute is less than thirty feet wide. Though not so conspicuous
as the sills some of these dikes are of interest because they
contain various ore minerals, principally copper, which today form small
deposits along their borders. About the beginning of the century these
were responsible for a short-lived mining boom, the best known vestige
of which is the remains of the mill at Cracker Lake. The old Cracker
Mine, with entrance now caved in, was driven along a dike which has
a width of over 100 feet.</p>
<p>From the boat landing at the head of Josephine Lake the dump of
another mine appears as a tiny gray-green mound on a narrow shelf high
on the precipitous wall of Grinnell Point. Like the Cracker Mine this
one was dug along the edge of a similar but smaller dike. All these
deposits are insignificant in size and of no commercial value. Had they
been important this great area might never have been set aside as a
national park.</p>

<h2 id="c13">The Story Continues</h2>
<p>For the succeeding several hundred million years the geologic history
of Glacier National Park is rather obscure, but additional Belt sediments
apparently were deposited before uplift of the area caused the sea to
withdraw. Following this event many feet of the younger Belt sediments
were removed by erosion. The sea probably returned and received more
sediments during much of the Paleozoic Era, although no trace of these
rocks has been found inside the park boundaries.</p>
<h3 id="c14">CRETACEOUS ROCKS.</h3>
<p>Not until the Cretaceous period of Earth
history, about 100 million years ago, did the geologic record again become
clear. At that time a great thickness of mud and sand was deposited in
the geosyncline burying deeply the ancient Belt and other rocks which
had accumulated as sediment during the preceding several hundred million
years. Life had made tremendous advances in this interval, and the
abundance of fossils in Cretaceous rocks indicates that the sea swarmed
with shelled creatures during that period.</p>
<h3 id="c15">THE LEWIS OVERTHRUST.</h3>
<p>Toward the end of Cretaceous time
tremendous crustal forces, principally from the west, were directed
against the geosyncline with the result that its rocks were compressed
and uplifted, converting the site of the former sea into a mountainous
region. Similar activity took place throughout the length and breadth
of the entire geosyncline, which resulted in the formation of the Rocky
Mountain system stretching between Mexico and Alaska. A number of
mountains were formed on other continents during this period. So widespread
and tremendous was the deformation, especially in the present
day Rocky Mountain region, that it is known as the <b>Rocky Mountain</b>, or
<b>Laramide</b> (after the Laramie Range in Wyoming), revolution. Mountain-building
forces continued for several million years in the Glacier
Park area, finally squeezing the rocks into a great fold (anticline).
Continued pressure from the west overturned the fold and put additional
strain on the rock layers, eventually causing them to break along a great
low-angle fault. The western limb of the fold, now a great slice of the
crust, was driven upward and eastward over the eastern limb ultimately
reversing the order of rock layers by placing older on top of younger
ones (<a href="#fig_3">Figure 3</a>). These younger layers are Cretaceous shales and sandstones
underlying the plains immediately east of the mountains. The
mountains themselves have been carved by streams and glaciers from
the Belt formations comprising the upper block of older rock, that slice
of the crust which has been moved more than 15 miles toward the east.
The surface over which it was pushed is the Lewis overthrust. At the
time this great break occurred the part of it now exposed in Glacier
National Park was deeply buried. It was long after that when removal
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
by erosion of overlying Belt rocks, possibly several thousand feet of
them, finally exposed the fault.</p>

<p>Movement along this fault was slow&mdash;so slow that had people
been present at the time they probably would not have been aware that
anything of an unusual nature was occurring. Occasionally along many
large faults, however, there is sudden movement of small magnitude,
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
usually not more than a few inches, but strong enough to vibrate the
crust. These vibrations are earthquakes, and their frequent occurrence
in California and elsewhere along the Pacific coast indicates the presence
of numerous active faults. Their occurrence also in the northern
Rockies, as at Helena, Montana in 1935 and 1936, attests to the fact that
some of the faults here are still active.</p>
<p>The Lewis overthrust comes to the surface at the base of the Altyn
formation along the entire precipitous east front of the Lewis Range and
can be traced nearly 100 miles northward into Canada and for almost
an equal distance south of the park. The section lying within the park
is tilted very gently toward the southwest, the angle of dip seldom exceeding
ten degrees. In some places it is practically horizontal. For
this reason the lower courses of all the largest, and some of the small,
valleys on the east side of the Lewis Range have been cut entirely through
the upper block (overthrust) of Belt rocks down into the weak Cretaceous
shales underneath. This causes the trace of the overthrust to be
very sinuous and also accounts for the deep indentations in the mountain
front formed by Swiftcurrent, St. Mary, Two Medicine, and other valleys.
The floors in the lower courses of these valleys, because they lie below
the level of the thrust surface, are composed of Cretaceous shales. In
most places these rocks are covered by glacial moraine, but they are
exposed along the highway from Babb into the Swiftcurrent Valley,
especially along the shore of Sherburne Reservoir and near the entrance
station. Because these shales readily disintegrate when exposed to the
atmosphere they give rise to slumps and landslides which, although of
small proportions, cause a great deal of damage to the highway, sections
of which must be rebuilt annually. At most damaged spots along the
route the shales appear as a dark mud or clay in the roadcuts. The
bumpy topography of the whole slope lying north of the road has been
formed by innumerable such small landslides.</p>
<p>A deep well located near Cameron Falls in Waterton Townsite
(Waterton Lakes National Park) about one mile west of the edge of
the mountains passes through 1,500 feet of Belt rocks and then penetrates
the Lewis overthrust and the Cretaceous shales beneath.</p>
<p>In the southern part of Glacier National Park just north of Marias
Pass, Debris Creek has cut a hole or &ldquo;window&rdquo; (known as a <b>fenster</b> by
geologists) through the overthrust block (<a href="#fig_2">Figure 2</a>). Thus a small area
of Cretaceous rock completely surrounded by the Belt series lies within
the mountains. This is the only such Cretaceous outcrop in the park,
but like the well at Waterton, it serves as a reminder that the rocks of this
period are everywhere present under the mountains, and their surface
constitutes the &ldquo;sliding board&rdquo; over which the upper, more massive
block of Belt rocks was pushed. And so we see that the mountains of
Glacier National Park, unlike many of the world&rsquo;s great ranges, have
no roots, for they rest on a base of greatly different and much less
resistant material, the Cretaceous shales. Presumably the Lewis overthrust
and Cretaceous rocks beneath it would be penetrated by a well
drilled anywhere within the mountains, although in the Livingstone
Range the depth of such a well would be very great (<a href="#fig_3">Figure 3</a>D).</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Erosion in the eastern part of the overthrust block, in addition to
producing its crenulated edge, has left several isolated remnants (outliers)
east of the main mass of the mountains. The best known of these
is Chief Mountain situated near the northeast corner of the park several
miles west of the Chief Mountain International Highway. It is a mass
of Altyn limestone rising vertically on its east, south and north sides
for a distance of 1,500 feet. The Lewis overthrust is well exposed all
around its base. Two smaller pinnacles immediately to the west are
similar outliers, and, like Chief Mountain, were once part of the main
mass of the Lewis Range (<a href="#fig_3">Figure 3</a>D and <a href="#cover">cover sketch</a>). Divide Peak,
at the west end of Hudson Bay Divide, is another outlier. It, too, is composed
entirely of the Altyn formation.</p>
<p>Although the Lewis overthrust is exposed in a great number of
places very few of these are easily accessible, and at only one does a
trail provide a close approach to the actual contact between Belt and
Cretaceous rocks. The latter site lies along Roes Creek only a few
hundred yards from East Glacier Campground. Before reaching the fault
at the base of a high cliff of Altyn limestone, the trail crosses several
outcrops of Cretaceous sandstone replete with fossil pelecypods (clams)
and gastropods (snails). The fault surface is covered by loose rock
where the trail crosses it, but on the opposite side of the stream a zone
of crushed Altyn limestone and Cretaceous shale is visible.</p>
<p>From U. S. Highway No. 2 just east of Marias Pass an excellent
distant view of the thrust may be obtained. About three miles to the
north it appears as a nearly horizontal line high on the side of Summit
Mountain. Above it is a vertical cliff in which white Altyn and red
Grinnell are prominent, and below is a gentler slope composed of gray-brown
Cretaceous shale.</p>
<p>Cretaceous rocks with relatively low resistance to Earth stresses,
were strongly crumpled and folded during the period of overthrusting.
The folded zone extends several miles eastward from the mountains
(<a href="#fig_3">Figure 3</a>D), and may be seen to good advantage along Blackfeet Highway
on the north side of Two Medicine Ridge, where a series of thin
shales and sandstones has been squeezed into anticlines and synclines.</p>
<p>It is because of the Lewis overthrust that there are no significant
foothills on the east side of the Lewis Range. The fault has brought
into direct contact the massive and resistant Belt rocks which stand up
as mountains, and the relatively weak shales of the plains which are
carved into subdued landscape features by erosion.</p>

</div>
<p>After the Lewis overthrust had taken place, and probably following
a period of erosion, the western part of the block broke along a vertical
fault and sank several thousand feet. For a short period of time a lake,
in which clay was deposited, covered the floor of this depressed area.
The present valley of the North Fork of the Flathead River lies on this
downfaulted block (<a href="#fig_3">Figure 3</a>D), and the western boundary of the
Livingstone Range marks the trace of the fault. Because the fault is
of the high-angle variety the front of this range is much straighter than
that of the Lewis Range which is formed by the notched eastern edge
of the relatively thin overthrust block. The Belton Hills and Apgar
Mountains near the park&rsquo;s west entrance are isolated blocks separated
from the Livingstone Range by normal faults probably dating from the
time the North Fork Valley subsided.</p>
<h2 id="c16">The Effect of the Ice Age</h2>
<p>In Miocene and Pliocene time the mountains were deeply eroded by
streams. It was during this time that Chief Mountain, Divide Peak, and
two smaller outliers, and the fenster along Debris Creek were formed.
All of the existing mountain valleys were cut out of the overthrust block,
although not to as great a depth as they have today. The time required
for their formation amounted to several millions of years. The result
of all this erosion was a landscape very similar to the present day Blue
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
Ridge in Virginia and North Carolina, the type which geologists call
mature.</p>
<p>Near the close of Pliocene time the climate cooled, timberline began
to lower, and increasing amounts of permanent snow accumulated in the
higher parts of the mountains. Finally glaciers formed from the snow
and began to move down the stream-carved valleys. This marked the
advent of Pleistocene time (The Glacial Age) nearly a million years ago.
Glaciers eventually filled all valleys and covered all the park area except
the summits of the highest peaks. Glaciers extended from valleys on
the east side of the Lewis Range far out onto the plains, and from the
Livingstone Range and the west side of the Lewis Range they moved
into the wide Flathead Valley. The forests disappeared and it is probable
that not a single tree remained in the area which is now the park.
Available evidence indicates that climatic fluctuations during Pleistocene
time caused the glaciers to disappear for a considerable period of time,
or at least to shrink to insignificant size and then to return. At the end
of Pleistocene time they began to shrink and about 9,000 years ago,
during what is generally regarded as post-Pleistocene time, disappeared
again.</p>
<p>The large Pleistocene glaciers greatly altered the pre-existing landscape
of the park by gouging out valleys to much greater depth, and
making their sides and heads much steeper than the streams had been
able to cut them. Most of the lakes, vertical cliffs, sharp peaks, and
waterfalls which constitute much of the park&rsquo;s magnificent scenery were
created as a result of intensive glacier action.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<h2 id="c17">The Last Chapter</h2>
<p>Although events of the last 9,000 or so years didn&rsquo;t create the large
spectacular features of the landscape, this period is nonetheless interesting
because it witnessed the birth of all existing park glaciers and the
return of the trees composing the present-day forests. As soon as the
glaciers began to shrink trees undoubtedly started to reclothe the newly
exposed surfaces. New varieties came from areas which had not been
glaciated. From the Pacific coast came grand fir, Douglas fir, larch,
hemlock, white pine and others. From the east came another group
including aspen, paper birch, hawthorn and maple. The native trees
driven out by the ice also returned to again become important elements
of the flora. These are Engelmann spruce, alpine fir, and lodgepole pine.
A few species, among which are the alpine willows, driven southward
from the far north during the Pleistocene period still persist at high altitudes
but they are always ready to move down into the valleys if the
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
climate should again become cool. Of course, continued warming would
cause them to disappear. After the large Pleistocene streams of ice disappeared
there followed a period of about 5,000 years during which the
climate was somewhat warmer and drier than at present, conditions
under which even very small glaciers could not have survived. Then
about 4,000 years ago the advent of the cooler climate brought about the
origin of the present glaciers. During the period of their existence they
have fluctuated in size, probably attaining maximum dimensions around
the middle of the last century. Since then they have been steadily shrinking,
a sure indication that the climate is becoming milder, as it has so
many times in the past.</p>

<p>Surrounding all these small glaciers are <b>recent moraines</b> composed
of rock debris eroded from the basins in which glaciers lie. These
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
moraines thus represent the
amount of material removed, and
then deposited, within the last
4,000 years. They are particularly
striking at Grinnell and Sperry

</div>
<p>Following disappearance of the
large Pleistocene glaciers streams
returned to the valleys and began
to cut new valleys within the old.
Because post-Pleistocene time has
been of such short duration these
new valleys are small youthful
gorges. Interesting examples are
Sunrift Gorge, where Baring
Creek has cut a narrow channel into the upper part of the Appekunny
formation; and the gorge at Hidden Falls on Hidden Creek in the Grinnell
Valley. Sunrift Gorge lies only a few feet north of Going-to-the-Sun
Highway at Baring Creek bridge, and Hidden Gorge is a stop on the
guided trip which Ranger-Naturalists conduct from Many Glacier Hotel
to Grinnell Lake. Both of these channels have very smooth, straight
sides because they have been eroded along vertical fractures known as
joints. The latter are common throughout the mountains and are responsible
for the smooth surfaces on some of the highest cliffs. The
gorge of Avalanche Creek near Avalanche Campground is another
example of post-glacial stream erosion, only here the whirling action
of sand and gravel-laden water has carved out a number of cylindrical
<b>potholes</b> in the stream course. Some of them, though only 6 to 10 feet
across, are 20 or more feet deep.</p>
<p>Since we know that the streams did not begin to cut these gorges
until the large Pleistocene glaciers had disappeared from those sites,
approximately 10,000 years have been required for their formation. Thus
the average maximum rate of down-cutting has been of the magnitude of
0.002 to 0.003 inch per year. With these figures as a foundation it is not
so difficult to comprehend that the much larger valleys of the park
could not have been eroded in less than several millions of years.</p>
<p>Another common, though seldom noticed, post-glacial feature of the
park is the <b>alluvial fan</b>. These are fan-shaped accumulations of gravel
deposited by swift, tributary streams where they enter a main valley.
Some of them have grown so large as to dam the stream in the major
valley and cause a lake (<a href="#fig_2">Figure 2</a>). St. Mary, Lower St. Mary, Lower
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
Two Medicine, and Waterton Lakes are held in by such dams. The alluvial
fan of Divide Creek which holds in St. Mary Lake can easily be distinguished
from Going-to-the-Sun Highway on the north side of the lake
near its outlet. The St. Mary Entrance Station is located on this fan.
The lower lake is dammed by a large fan built into the St. Mary Valley
by Swiftcurrent Creek. The straight section of highway between the
town of Babb and the St. Mary River bridge lies on the lower part of
this fan. Inasmuch as the Pleistocene glaciers undoubtedly removed any
such fans made previously, those which are present today must have
been constructed since disappearance of the ice, and are then not more
than 12,000 years old. Most of them are somewhat older, possibly by
as much as two or three thousand years, than the gorges mentioned above,
because the latter are located nearer the source of the glaciers, and their
sites were thus still covered by ice after the fans had already begun to
form. After the Pleistocene glaciers began their final retreat several
thousand years elapsed before they disappeared from the mountains.</p>

<span class="jr">(DYSON PHOTO)</span></p>
</div>
<p>One of the most conspicuous of
all post-glacial features is the <b>talus
cone</b>, an accumulation of angular
rock fragments which fall from
cliffs. It is only at the base of a
crevice or chimney that this material
takes the apparent form of
a distinct cone. Elsewhere it is referred
to as a <b>talus slope</b> or simply
as <b>talus</b>, or, in the parlance of some
mountaineers, as <b>scree</b>. Although
several thousand years have been
required for their formation most
talus accumulations in the park are
still actively growing, especially in
spring and early summer when rocks are pried loose by the alternate
freezing and thawing of moisture within fractures. The artillery-like
crack made when a falling rock crashes to the base of a high cliff is a
familiar sound to anyone who has spent much time in the mountains.</p>
<h2 id="c18">The Future</h2>
<p>We know that the processes of erosion and weathering will continue,
that alluvial fans and talus cones will grow larger, and gorges will be
eroded deeper, and as a result the mountains will be cut down to lower
elevations. But, as we have seen, this event will require much time. If
the present climate continues for a few more years our remaining glaciers
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
will disappear, but there is nothing in geologic history which says they
won&rsquo;t return again, possibly even to the size of their heyday in the
Pleistocene. And if history repeats itself, and all past geologic history
has been a repetition, then the mountains will eventually be worn down
to an uneventful plain and the sea will invade the land again.</p>
<p>But certain breeds of man are the only despoilers of mountains that
we need fear, so if the good citizens of our land keep the human invader
and his dams and earth-moving equipment out of our national parks these
grand mountains will endure for many thousands, yes, even millions
of years.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
